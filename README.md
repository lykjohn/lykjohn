### Hi, I am John Lee. Welcome to my repositories! 👋

I am the founder of Aries Profits, an online school that teaches data-driven trading and investing. I created this school because financial education is a crucial piece of our everyday lives, yet it's mainly being privatized by the so-called "field professionals". I aim to democratize such education by integrating the knowledge-sharing culture from the technological area and to improve its accessibility to the greater public.

As a higher education teacher, I had previously been a Lecturer at the University of Chicago and taught Data Science courses to college-level students of all backgrounds. What I enjoy most about teaching is that I am able to engage with students on both individual and team levels. My vision is to create a learning community for students to embrace uncertainty, obstruction, and frustration throughout their learning journey.
