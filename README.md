### Hi, I am John. Welcome to my page ! 👋

I am a research assistant of statistics and finance at the University of Michigan. On the statistical side, my reasearch revolves around predictions of rare events under the Bayesian statistical belief and implementations of spatial-temporal models on circumstantial loss events. A completed project involves model development to forecast worldwide economic recessions. On the financial side, my research stretches from analyzing corporate fundamentals to developing investment automation algorithms with adequate risk control. A completed project involves Enterprise Risk Management for Small Businesses (ERMSB). I am skilled in information retrieval and language recognition tactics in a web environment. A finished project includes mining Letters to Shareholders from the annual reports of the S&P 500 companies, followed by analyzing sentiments reflected by the Chief Executive Officer in each letter.
