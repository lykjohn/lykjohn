### Hi, I am John Lee. Welcome to my repositories! 👋

Experienced researcher, lecturer, and founder in the field of education technology, with the ultimate goal to help students happily achieve success.

I am a Research Statistician at the College Board. I am there to novelize and refine analytical solutions for psychometric analyses. Examples include prototyping software applications to improve students' assessment experience, implementing statistical learning models to optimize item analysis, and refining proprietary programs to support the suite of assessment products, such as AP and SAT tests.

As a higher education teacher, I have been a Lecturer at the University of Chicago since 2022 and have taught Data Science courses to college-level students of all backgrounds. What I enjoy most about teaching is that I am able to engage with students on both individual and team levels. My vision is to create a learning community for students to embrace uncertainty, obstruction, and frustration throughout their learning journey.

I am the founder of Aries Profits, an online school that teaches data-driven trading and investing. I created this school because financial education is a crucial piece of our everyday lives, yet it's mainly being privatized by the so-called "field professionals". I aim to democratize such education by integrating the knowledge-sharing culture from the technological area and to improve its accessibility to the greater public.
